## Hacktoberfest 2022

It's [Hacktoberfest month](https://hacktoberfest.com)! ðŸ¥³

Thanks so much for participating with Meilisearch this year!

1. We will follow the quality standards set by the organizers of Hacktoberfest (see detail on their [website](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#spam)). Our reviewers will not consider any PR that doesnâ€™t match that standard.
2. PRs reviews will take place from Monday to Thursday, during usual working hours, CEST time. If you submit outside of these hours, thereâ€™s no need to panic; we will get around to your contribution.
3. There will be no issue assignment as we donâ€™t want people to ask to be assigned specific issues and never return, discouraging the volunteer contributors from opening a PR to fix this issue. We take the liberty to choose the PR that best fixes the issue, so we encourage you to get to it as soon as possible and do your best!

## Assumptions

1. **You're familiar with [GitHub](https://github.com) and the [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)(PR) workflow.**
2. **You've read the Meilisearch [documentation](https://docs.meilisearch.com) and the [README](/README.md).**
3. **You know about the [Meilisearch community](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/what_is_meilisearch/contact.html). Please use this for help.**

## How to Contribute

1. Make sure that the contribution you want to make is explained or detailed in a GitHub issue! Find an [existing issue](https://github.com/meilisearch/demos/issues/) or [open a new one](https://github.com/meilisearch/demos/issues/new).
2. Once done, [fork the demos repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) in your own GitHub account. Ask a maintainer if you want your issue to be checked before making a PR.
3. [Create a new Git branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).
4. Consult the README present in the project folder you want to contribute to, it should have all the information needed to set the project up.
5. Make the changes on your branch.
6. [Submit the branch as a PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) pointing to the `main` branch of the main demos repository. A maintainer should comment and/or review your Pull Request within a few days. Although depending on the circumstances, it may take longer.<br>
 We do not enforce a naming convention for the PRs, but **please use something descriptive of your changes**.

## Git Guidelines

### Git Branches <!-- omit in toc -->

All changes must be made in a branch and submitted as PR.
We do not enforce any branch naming style, but please use something descriptive of your changes.

### Git Commits <!-- omit in toc -->

As minimal requirements, your commit message should:
- be capitalized
- not finish by a dot or any other punctuation character (!,?)
- start with a verb so that we can read your commit message this way: "This commit will ...", where "..." is the commit message.
  e.g.: "Fix the home page button" or "Add more tests for create_index method"

We don't follow any other convention, but if you want to use one, we recommend [this one](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

### GitHub Pull Requests <!-- omit in toc -->

Some notes on GitHub PRs:

- [Convert your PR as a draft](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) if your changes are a work in progress: no one will review it until you pass your PR as ready for review.<br>
  The draft PR can be very useful if you want to show that you are working on something and make your work visible.
- The branch related to the PR must be **up-to-date with `main`** before merging. 
- All PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer.
- The PR title should be accurate and descriptive of the changes.
